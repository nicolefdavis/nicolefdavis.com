          <h2>How can happy employees create a consistent, quality experience for Basecamp's customers? </h2>

          <p>This is the type of question I believe comes to the mind of the typical Basecamp customers. Why? Because they are heart leaders. Who are heart leaders? Heart leaders work hard to understand the pains and challenges of their customers. They build products that solve real problems. </p>

          <p>Heart leaders are more interested in positively changing the lives of their customers than they are the number of sales. They genuinely care about their employees’ wellbeing and want them to be happy. Heart leaders turn to Basecamp because everything you do helps them stay true to these principles. In other words, they share the same values as Basecamp.</p>

          <div class="blockquote">
            <span>...employee</span> and <span>customer</span> happiness first.
          </div>

          <p> Over the years, Basecamp has beautifully built its brand presence in the world because of the genuine and thoughtful insights its leadership and teams share blogging, speaking at conferences, delivering podcasts and writing books. </p>

          <p>For many professional marketers, these actions are seen as a “thought leadership” approach to building a brand. However, I believe your actions are better termed as “heart leadership” because you’re not providing generic insights that are focused primarily on business growth. Instead, you provide beneficial insights that help encourage businesses to pursue achieving employee and customer happiness first.</p>

          <h2>How can Basecamp attract more heart leaders? </h2>
          <p>Become the go-to resource for business leaders looking for guidance on how to build meaningful products and fulfilled teams. This type of positioning can resonate with new customers but I recommend first starting with existing customers.</p>

          <p>Basecamp has over 100,000 paying customers who are already aligned with Basecamp’s values. Let's build a permanent community by and for these business leaders. Let's create more memories with its current customers by offering more learning opportunities and leading community activities.</p>

          <p>Creative execution of this could be launching a resource center under a Heart Leadership University banner where you offer quality educational content via workshops, webinars or a Basecamp TV experience. You can also invite your current customers to Basecamp live conferences. These are all experiences you can use to help reinforce community and give customers something to spread the word about.</p>

          <h2>Who am I?</h2>

          <p>Hi – I’m Nicole, a passionate big picture marketer who loves solving problems and helping businesses improve the lives of their customers. As an American  born native of the Danish West Indies, the warmth of sunshine brings me pure joy. In my spare time you could find me on wellness blogs looking for DIY health remedies and the next best healthy recipe for chocolate chip cookies or birthday cakes. </p>

          <p>Most of my 14 year career was lived at Nationwide where I focused on end-to-end management of integrated brand marketing campaigns. This means that I have experience defining a big picture strategy and working with creatives and agencies to deliver the pieces and parts needed to make that strategy come to life. </p>

          <div class="blockquote">
            My time as an <span>Amazon merchant</span> was a wonderful and exciting experience...
          </div>

          <p>After the birth of our first child, I made the choice to leave the corporate world and start a consumer focused product business and work remotely from home to balance my family/career equation.</p>

          <p>During that time, I built a niche Amazon brand called <a href="https://pureroyalbrands.com/" target="_blank">Pure Royal Brands</a> which designed, manufactured and shipped aromatherapy essential oil diffusers and humidifiers to customers in the United States.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/01.png" alt="essential oil diffuser"/></p>

          <p>My time as an Amazon merchant was a wonderful and exciting experience where I got to explore my creative product development side and balance it with working with overseas manufacturing partners.</p>

          <p>Today, I’m excited to join a healthy work family. I am ready to continue my life’s journey with a new chapter in marketing that’s focused on helping companies solve problems and build meaningful connections with its customers.</p>

          <h2>How I've taken an existing brand to a new place and how I would begin to approach Basecamp's marketing strategy?</h2>

          <p>As a Marketing Campaign Manager, I helped position Nationwide as a company that offers best-in-class knowledge and support to financial advisors needing to help their clients plan for challenges like unexpected health care cost in retirement. </p>

          <div class="blockquote">
            Managed over <span>1M+</span> dollar marketing budget to work with top agencies like <span>McKinney</span>.
          </div>

          <p>I partnered with an internal cross-functional team to expand our existing web content by integrating more education and engagement resources that prepared advisors for conversations with their clients. In the process, I managed a 1M+ marketing dollar budget and worked with our Creative Agencies of Record (McKinney and Universal McCann) to deliver strategic advertising plans that built awareness amongst financial advisors of everything Nationwide had to offer. </p>

          <p>To help Basecamp define its brand strategy, I would first listen to customers wherever they live online (forums, social media, blog comments, support emails) to understand their challenges and how they perceive Basecamp. I would then help Basecamp clearly articulate who you are and how you address the pains and challenges of your customers. With a full picture of you and your customer, I can better identify the specific tools (e.g. brand guidelines, content strategy, partnerships) needed to help communicate your brand story.</p>

          <h2>Example of a small-to-medium sized business I think markets themselves well </h2>

          <p>I’ve come to admire the life and business coach, Marie Forleo for her approach to marketing. She’s doing an amazing job because she is crystal clear about who she wants to reach and how she will serve them.</p>

          <p>Marie’s followers are creatives looking to build a business doing what they love and everything she does helps inspire them to go for their dreams. She attracts many to her business with her inspiring online MarieTV show that helps address the challenges of building a business around what makes you happy. She engages her audience through email and offers online courses that help them gain the skills needed to build a sustainable online business.</p>

          <h2>A creative agency I think is doing particularly interesting work</h2>
          <p>Enso Creative Impact Agency (https://www.enso.co) is a creative agency that builds their business around social good. They help companies that want to have a positive impact on society using their strategic, creative and community building skills. </p>
          <p>Because Basecamp is helping companies rethink the way teams should work, I think you are a perfect client fit for them. Like you, they are making positive impact and business success one and the same. </p>

        <h2>A time when great marketing caught my attention and turned me into a customer</h2>
        <p>When Primal Kitchen launched its paleo health foods line I immediately became a customer; but it wasn’t an advertisement on Facebook or coupon in a magazine that resulted in my purchase of their paleo friendly mayonnaise and ketchup. It actually was a series of events. I’ve been a follower of Mark Sisson, the founder of Primal Kitchen for years on his blog, marksdailyapple.com. </p>

        <p>I also follow other paleo bloggers who have collaborated with Mark to help people meet their health goals. So, I already had a connection with Mark and began to trust his views on living a paleo lifestyle. I say all of this to point out that great marketing isn’t just one event. It’s a series of touches and experiences. It’s creating memories and building trust that leads to buying customers. </p>

        <h2>Something I almost bought recently, but decided not to</h2>
        <p>My husband and I were recently in search of a new household laptop. Usually we would just go get a MacBook Pro but this time was different. After hearing so many stories of newer MacBook Pros having keyboard and GPU issues we started to question Apple’s commitment to quality. Today Apple’s reputation for quality isn’t as strong; and the lesson here is that we need to be consistent in delivering what we promise to customers. Brand consistency ensures customers see you as trustworthy and dependable. </p>

        <h2>What has inspired me lately </h2>
        <p>My family and I often visit the <a href="https://www.rollins.edu/cornell-fine-arts-museum/" target="_blank">Cornell Fine Arts Museum</a> at my Alma mater, Rollins College and it’s always inspiring to see how artists use their work to tell a story. </p>

        <p>In one exhibit, I remember a strikingly, remarkable piece created by an Argentine Artist, Tomás Saraceno. It was a floating sculpture of actual spider webs.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/03.jpg" alt="We are all connected in the web of humanity."/></p>

        <p>Tomás took unrelated spider species (solitary, social, and semi-social) and housed them together in a cube where each of their web architectures formed together to create a unique sculpture. </p>

        <p>I was inspired by Tomás’ work because it reminded me of how we as humans are all different, yet we are so interconnected and collectively shape the world we live in.</p>

        <p>My 20 year marketing plan for Basecamp is to forge a new human web of existing and new customers and see what we can build.</p>
