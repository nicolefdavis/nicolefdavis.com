          <h2>Imagine a world where people thrive doing what they love. </h2>
          <p>"Can I 'make it' by just selling my art? I'm turning 29 this month and I've decided I want so badly to not have to work 50 hours a week anymore for a job that pays me just enough to get by with about $50 left in my account each month.
             I want to start selling my art and hopefully be able to live off doing that for the rest of my life... but I'm scared that (with drawing being my only skill) it won't be enough for me to start my own business and work for myself". – Artist on Reddit </p>

          <h2>Many want to know - "Can I make it" doing what I love? </h2>

          <p>There are many artists and creatives who know they are meant for something more. They have natural gifts and want to use them to start a business. They want to change their financial situation and be happy living life on their terms. They know that building and running a business will give them the power to influence the world in their own special way.</p>

          <p>I think it’s amazing that Marie has an opportunity to inspire artists and creatives to go for their dreams and I would love to bring my own marketing skills to the table to help you reach customers and let them know that they can address the challenges of building and running a sustainable business around what makes them happy.</p>

          <p>Creative execution of this could be launching a resource center under a Heart Leadership University banner where you offer quality educational content via workshops, webinars or a Basecamp TV experience. You can also invite your current customers to Basecamp live conferences. These are all experiences you can use to help reinforce community and give customers something to spread the word about.</p>

          <h2>Who am I?</h2>

          <p>Hi – I’m Nicole, a passionate marketer who loves solving problems and helping businesses improve the lives of their customers. As an American born native of the Danish West Indies, the warmth of sunshine brings me pure joy. In my spare time you could find me on wellness blogs looking for DIY health remedies and the next best healthy recipe for chocolate chip cookies or birthday cakes.</p>

          <p>Most of my 14-year career was lived at Nationwide where I focused on end-to-end management of integrated marketing campaigns. This means that I have experience defining a big picture strategy and working with a cross-functional team to deliver the pieces and parts needed to make that strategy come to life. During my time at Nationwide I launched product and brand focused marketing campaigns and events. I also led advertising campaigns that generated leads and maximized revenue of Nationwide’s financial products. </p>


          <div class="blockquote">
          As an Amazon merchant <span>I successfully launched advertising campaigns</span> resulting in new traffic and revenue.
          </div>

          <p>After the birth of our first child, I made the choice to leave the corporate world and start a consumer focused product business and work remotely from home to balance my family/career equation.</p>

          <p>During that time, I built a niche Amazon brand called <a href="https://pureroyalbrands.com/" target="_blank">Pure Royal Brands</a> which designed, manufactured and shipped aromatherapy essential oil diffusers and humidifiers to customers in the United States.</p>

          <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/01.png" alt="essential oil diffuser"/></p>

          <p>My time as an Amazon merchant was a wonderful and exciting experience where I got to explore my creative product development side and balance it with working with overseas manufacturing partners. I also successfully launched advertising campaigns that resulted in new traffic and product sales. </p>

          <p>Today, I’m excited to join a healthy work family. I am ready to continue my life’s journey with a new chapter in marketing that’s focused on helping companies solve problems and build meaningful connections with its customers.</p>

          <h2>Why I want to join Team Forleo?</h2>

          <p>I believe in your mission. I believe that people can achieve building a business doing what they love. I believe that Marie Forleo is doing awesome work offering the right tools and resources so that many can take action and change their lives. At my core, I love helping people and would love to help you make dreams happen for your audience. </p>

          <div class="blockquote">

        <!--  <p>I partnered with an internal cross-functional team to expand our existing web content by integrating more education and engagement resources that prepared advisors for conversations with their clients. In the process, I managed a 1M+ marketing dollar budget and worked with our Creative Agencies of Record (McKinney and Universal McCann) to deliver strategic advertising plans that built awareness amongst financial advisors of everything Nationwide had to offer. </p>

          <p>To help Basecamp define its brand strategy, I would first listen to customers wherever they live online (forums, social media, blog comments, support emails) to understand their challenges and how they perceive Basecamp. I would then help Basecamp clearly articulate who you are and how you address the pains and challenges of your customers. With a full picture of you and your customer, I can better identify the specific tools (e.g. brand guidelines, content strategy, partnerships) needed to help communicate your brand story.</p>-->

          <p>I’ve come to admire the life and business coach, Marie Forleo for her approach to marketing. She’s doing an amazing job because she is crystal clear about who she wants to reach and how she will serve them.</p>

          <p>Marie’s followers are creatives looking to build a business doing what they love and everything she does helps inspire them to go for their dreams. She attracts many to her business with her inspiring online MarieTV show that helps address the challenges of building a business around what makes you happy.

          <p>Because Basecamp is helping companies rethink the way teams should work, I think you are a perfect client fit for them. Like you, they are making positive impact and business success one and the same. </p>-->

        <!--<h2>A time when great marketing caught my attention and turned me into a customer</h2>
        <p>When Primal Kitchen launched its paleo health foods line I immediately became a customer; but it wasn’t an advertisement on Facebook or coupon in a magazine that resulted in my purchase of their paleo friendly mayonnaise and ketchup. It actually was a series of events. I’ve been a follower of Mark Sisson, the founder of Primal Kitchen for years on his blog, marksdailyapple.com. </p>

        <p>I also follow other paleo bloggers who have collaborated with Mark to help people meet their health goals. So, I already had a connection with Mark and began to trust his views on living a paleo lifestyle. I say all of this to point out that great marketing isn’t just one event. It’s a series of touches and experiences. It’s creating memories and building trust that leads to buying customers. </p>-->

        <!--<h2>Something I almost bought recently, but decided not to</h2>
        <p>My husband and I were recently in search of a new household laptop. Usually we would just go get a MacBook Pro but this time was different. After hearing so many stories of newer MacBook Pros having keyboard and GPU issues we started to question Apple’s commitment to quality. Today Apple’s reputation for quality isn’t as strong; and the lesson here is that we need to be consistent in delivering what we promise to customers. Brand consistency ensures customers see you as trustworthy and dependable. </p>-->

        <h2>What has inspired me lately </h2>
        <p>My family and I often visit the <a href="https://www.rollins.edu/cornell-fine-arts-museum/" target="_blank">Cornell Fine Arts Museum</a> at my Alma mater, Rollins College and it’s always inspiring to see how artists use their work to tell a story. </p>

        <p>In one exhibit, I remember a strikingly, remarkable piece created by an Argentine Artist, Tomás Saraceno. It was a floating sculpture of actual spider webs.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="u-max-full-width" src="../images/03.jpg" alt="We are all connected in the web of humanity."/></p>

        <p>Tomás took unrelated spider species (solitary, social, and semi-social) and housed them together in a cube where each of their web architectures formed together to create a unique sculpture. </p>

        <p>I was inspired by Tomás’ work because it reminded me of how we as humans are all different, yet we are so interconnected and collectively shape the world we live in. </p>

        <p> We all have something unique to bring to the table that can positively influence others; or in Marie's words, "The world needs that special gift that only you have".</p>
